U-Boot
######

Current Versions
================

Das U-Boot (or just "U-Boot" for short) is Open Source Firmware for Embedded Power ArchitectureÂ®, ARM, MIPS, x86 and other processors. The U-Boot project is hosted by DENX, where you can also find the project home page: http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/

The current version of the U-Boot source code can be retrieved from the DENX "git" repository.

You can browse the "git" repositories at http://git.denx.de/

The trees can be accessed through the git, HTTP, and rsync protocols. For example you can use one of the following commands to create a local clone of one of the source trees:

::

  git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git u-boot/
  git clone http://git.denx.de/u-boot.git u-boot/
  git clone rsync://git.denx.de/u-boot.git u-boot/

For details please see here.

Official releases of U-Boot are also available through FTP. Compressed tar archives can downloaded from the directory ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/. 

U-Boot Command Line Interface
=============================

The following section describes the most important commands available in U-Boot. Please note that U-Boot is highly configurable, so not all of these commands may be available in the configuration of U-Boot installed on your hardware, or additional commands may exist. You can use the help command to print a list of all available commands for your configuration.

For most commands, you do not need to type in the full command name; instead it is sufficient to type a few characters. For instance, help can be abbreviated as h.

The behaviour of some commands depends on the configuration of U-Boot and on the definition of some variables in your U-Boot environment.

Almost all U-Boot commands expect numbers to be entered in hexadecimal input format. (Exception: for historical reasons, the sleep command takes its argument in decimal input format.)

Be careful not to use edit keys besides 'Backspace', as hidden characters in things like environment variables can be very difficult to find.

Information Commands
--------------------

bdinfo - print Board Info structure
...................................

tbot_ref:help_bdinfo_tb_con_1_1.txt

The :redtext:`bdinfo` command (:redtext:`bdi`) prints the information that U-Boot passes about the board such as memory addresses and sizes, clock frequencies, MAC address, etc. This information is mainly needed to be passed to the Linux kernel.

coninfo - print console devices and informations
................................................

tbot_ref:help_conin_tb_con_1_1.txt

The :redtext:`coninfo` command (:redtext:`conin`) displays information about the available console I/O devices. 

tbot_ref:conin_tb_con_1_1.txt

The output contains the device name, flags, and the current usage. For example, the output

::

  serial@44e09000 00000003 IO stdin stdout stderr 
  
means that the serial device provides input (flag 'I') and output (flag 'O') functionality and is currently assigned to the 3 standard I/O streams stdin, stdout and stderr.
