tbot_ref:help_loop_tb_con_1_1.txt

The :redtext:`loop` command reads in a tight loop from a range of memory. This is intended as a special form of a memory test, since this command tries to read the memory as fast as possible.

|Warning| This command will never terminate. There is no way to stop it but to reset the board!
