bootm - boot application image from memory

Usage:
bootm [addr [arg ...]]
    - boot application image stored in memory
	passing arguments 'arg ...'; when booting a Linux kernel,
	'arg' can be the address of an initrd image
	When booting a Linux kernel which requires a flat device-tree
	a third argument is required which is the address of the
	device-tree blob. To boot that kernel without an initrd image,
	use a '-' for the second argument. If you do not pass a third
	a bd_info struct will be passed instead
	
For the new multi component uImage format (FIT) addresses
	must be extended to include component or configuration unit name:
	addr:<subimg_uname> - direct component image specification
	addr#<conf_uname>   - configuration specification
	Use iminfo command to get the list of existing component
	images and configurations.

Sub-commands to do part of the bootm sequence.  The sub-commands must be
issued in the order below (it's ok to not issue all sub-commands):
	start [addr [arg ...]]
	loados  - load OS image
	ramdisk - relocate initrd, set env initrd_start/initrd_end
	fdt     - relocate flat device tree
	cmdline - OS specific command line processing/setup
	bdt     - OS specific bd_t processing
	prep    - OS specific prep before relocation or go
	go      - start OS
