Introduction
============

This document describes how to use the firmware U-Boot and the operating system Linux in Embedded Power ArchitectureÂ®, ARM and MIPS Systems.

There are many steps along the way, and it is nearly impossible to cover them all in depth, but we will try to provide all necessary information to get an embedded system running from scratch. This includes all the tools you will probably need to configure, build and run U-Boot and Linux.

First, we describe how to install the Cross Development Tools Embedded Linux Development Kit which you probably need - at least when you use a standard x86 PC running Linux or a Sun Solaris 2.6 system as build environment.

Then we describe what needs to be done to connect to the serial console port of your target: you will have to configure a terminal emulation program like cu or kermit.

In most cases you will want to load images into your target using ethernet; for this purpose you need TFTP and DHCP / BOOTP servers. A short description of their configuration is given.

A description follows of what needs to be done to configure and build the U-Boot for a specific board, and how to install it and get it working on that board.

The configuration, building and installing of Linux in an embedded configuration is the next step. We use SELF, our Simple Embedded Linux Framework, to demonstrate how to set up both a development system (with the root filesystem mounted over NFS) and an embedded target configuration (running from a ramdisk image based on busybox).

This document does not describe what needs to be done to port U-Boot or Linux to a new hardware platform. Instead, it is silently assumed that your board is already supported by U-Boot and Linux.
