- move lab_api things to lab_api
- test
- lab_api:
  add ftp put and get
- call testcases with arguments
- add manpages for the testcases

----------------------------------------

- rework prompt
  save current prompt for each fd!!

- if tbot fails, start a git biscect section
  and find out, which commit did it

  done!

  src/tc/tc_board_git_bisect.py

  - store commit id when tc is good -> last good commit
    id is known
    
    src/tc/tc_board_tqm5200s_ub_comp_install.py
    saves the u-boot.bin, if u-boot boots

    -> if u-boot boot fails with new u-boot
       old u-boot is known -> now extract from last
       working the commit id ... and start:
       src/tc/tc_board_git_bisect.py

       then this is done!

- testcases for yocto
  - install yocto
  - install meta ..
  - patch bblayers.conf
  - patch local.conf
  - call bitbake
  - cp images

* readreg with devmem and compare with default from
  file:
  regaddr mask defaultvalue
  done: src/tc/tc_lx_check_reg_file.py

  * add testcase which fills this file
    done: src/tc/tc_lx_create_reg_file.py

- gpio tests
  - check registers with devmem
  - use readreg

* get a list of patchworknumbers from patchwork
  in your ToDo list ...
  done for u-boot:
  src/tc/tc_workfd_get_patchwork_number_list.py

* move power on/off into a testcase, and only
  call it from lap_api
  done:
  src/tc/tc_lab_denx_power.py

* get power state from a board through  testcase
  done:
  src/tc/tc_lab_denx_get_power_state.py

* move connect to a board into a testcase and
  call it from lap_api
  done:
  src/tc/tc_lab_denx_connect_to_board.py

  -> lap_api not really needed anymore ... sounds
     good ...

* timer for starting a testcase. Some testcases
  do extensive read/write/erase accesses, and if
  this is done very often (for example every night)
  hw gets damaged ... so add a possibility to
  start a testcase only if a timer expires ...
  done:
  src/tc/tc_workfd_check_tc_time.py
  used for example in:
  src/tc/tc_lx_bonnie.py
