How To add a new lab:

- if you use ssh for connecting to the lab host PC
  (recommended!) it is very easy:

- copy a well known working lab file from src/lab_api
  for example src/lab_api/denx.py

- There the ssh specific things are exported to
  src/lab_api/lab_ssh.py, and you don;t have to do this!

- Now you have to adapt 3 functions!

  - get_power_state(self, boardname)

    This function must return in which power state
    the board boardname is

  - set_power_state(self, boardname, state)

    This function deals with powering on/off
    your board boardname

  - connect_to_board(self, boardname)

    This function opens a connection to from the
    lab host PC to the console on the board boardname.

    This could be whatever you want.

    Currently just boards with serial connection used,
    but do here whatever you need to connect to the console
    of the board boardname.

Thats it! You have added a new lab, tbot should now to be
able to execute testcases on your board.
